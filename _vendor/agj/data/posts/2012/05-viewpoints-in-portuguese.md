A Brazilian fellow who calls himself [Douglas Mitsujii](http://www.mitsujii.com/) has [a website](http://labvermelho.blogspot.com/) in which he collects Flash games he finds particularly philosophical or emotive. He contacted me about translating my game _Viewpoints_ a month ago, and guess what, it's done already. The one upgrade I couldn't resist was the audio quality (lower and more efficient compression), so now the Portuguese version has one slight advantage over the original.
