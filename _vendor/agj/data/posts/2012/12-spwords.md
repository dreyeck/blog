What happens when you combine sports and words? That's right, the unholy portmanteau of this post's title. Conceived as a last minute entry into the [TIGSource Sports competition](http://www.tigsource.com/2012/10/31/tigcompo-sports/), _Spwords_ is a player-versus-computer match that puts your (English) vocabulary, spelling, and typing speed to the test.

[**Play _Spwords_**](//www.agj.cl/files/games/spwords/) (web)

Maybe you didn't understand the commentator's quick explanation of the rules. That's fine, that's what this paragraph is for. You and computer take turns typing words during rounds, and each round has an assigned letter. Each word played must start with the round's letter. Also, a word must contain the last played word's last letter for it to count. In addition to all this, you have a time limit, and words may never be repeated. Win three rounds to win the match. Have a go!

This game was possible thanks to [Keith Vertanen's word lists](http://keithv.com/software/wlist/).
