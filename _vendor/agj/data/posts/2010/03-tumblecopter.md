For last weekend's [Klik of the Month](/tag/kotm/) I only managed to get an older game project started, but couldn't finish anything. So it was neat to be invited by [Stephen](http://www.increpare.com/) to partake in an [impromptu KOTM](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/1160) today. I made a game in which you can't really control a helicopter.
