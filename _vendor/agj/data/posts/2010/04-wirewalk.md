I've made a thing for [an event](http://www.thegamescollective.org/index.php/topic,8.0.html) that [Stephen Lavelle](http://www.increpare.com/) describes as a 'pageant' —a competition sans the competitive aspect—, with the theme 'bricolage'. (I made [a promotional picture](//piclog.agj.cl/index.php?showimage=69) for the event, too.)

The thing I made is called _Wirewalk_. It's something that, I feel, is best not to describe. Just try it and see if you like it—shouldn't take you over a couple of minutes.
