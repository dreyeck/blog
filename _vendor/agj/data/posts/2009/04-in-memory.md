In the tradition of writing a new post for every new front page design I make, I guess I need to write this. My late feline friend, Cleo, passed away yesterday. I spent half my life with her at my side. So, I made a simple new design in her memory.

[The previous design has been archived](//www.agj.cl/files/archive/front2009-2/).
