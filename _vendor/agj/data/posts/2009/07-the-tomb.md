A few months ago, as I was waking up, and while I was halfway between being asleep and awake, I had this dream/idea for a game. When I woke up properly, I wrote it down in my sketchbook. And only a few hours ago, for this month's [Klik](/tag/kotm/), I made it concrete.

[**Download The Tomb**](//www.agj.cl/files/games/tomb.zip) (Windows, requires the latest DirectX)

[Construct](http://www.scirra.com/) and [NitroTracker](http://nitrotracker.tobw.net/) were the tools used this time around. I sampled my voice for the sounds.
