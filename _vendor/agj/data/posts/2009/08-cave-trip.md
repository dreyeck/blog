I had things to do and places to be Friday night and all Saturday, so only got started on my [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) entry by Saturday night. LD is a 48 hour competition in which I also participated four months ago; back then, I made [Heart](/tag/heart/). This time, I didn't get to make such a complete game. The theme was 'caverns', so I had planned to make a rhythmic game about flying through a cavern (okay, more like a tunnel) and avoiding obstacles to the beat. It was actually pretty hard to just get the visual effect right, so I got only as far as adding some randomized obstacles, and throwing in a sound effect upon hitting one. So, it's far from a complete game. The code that would allow me to add in a music track and have it be synchronized to the images is already there, at least.

This one was made using FlashDevelop and Flex SDK 4, coded in actionscript 3. Below you can see all those hours of work, squashed into just a few seconds.
