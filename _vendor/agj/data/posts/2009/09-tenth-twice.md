I forgot to report back then, but my game, [_Viewpoints_](/tag/viewpoints/), [got tenth place](http://tigsource.com/articles/2009/05/04/cockpit-compo-results) in the competition it was created for, TIGSource's Cockpit Competition. Considering that there were 41 entries, that's not too bad.

More surprising is that _[Sheets](/tag/sheets/)_, the game I entered in TIGSource's latest, the Adult/Educational Competition, [also got me in tenth place](http://tigsource.com/articles/2009/09/10/adult-educational-compo-results). This is so surprising due to my making the game in a rush to get something in at all, and it being mostly just a 'choose your own adventure' interactive story. More so, because there were a few very good games that didn't even make it into the top ten, such as Gregory Weir's [Silent Conversation](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=7192.0). All I can say is that I got lucky, this time.
