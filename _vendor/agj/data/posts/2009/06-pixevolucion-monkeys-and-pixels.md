[![Monkey games](/files/2009/06-pixevolucion-monkeys-and-pixels/monkeygames.jpg "Monkey games")](//piclog.agj.cl/index.php?showimage=49)

In 2006, for my workshop course in that year's first semester, I created [a graphic work](//piclog.agj.cl/index.php?showimage=49) that ironized technology and how the Monkey King (humanity) wreaks havoc on Earth through its lack of restraint and its egocentrism. The next semester I was to base an animation on that work.

This was a semester-long project (it kind of doesn't show, due to a long preliminary process) for Sebastián Skoknic and Bryan Phillips's course. Other than being my longest animation since, it marks the first time I ever did anything resembling sound design; I even splashed a bit in the tub to get some water sounds. The most interesting part was using the Game Boy Camera (thus the Game Boy sound hardware) for the electronic noise, which I think worked very well.

The subject of this piece remains the same as the one it's based on, though I didn't make any specific references to video games this once, just computers.
