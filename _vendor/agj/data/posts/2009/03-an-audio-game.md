Another Klik of the Month, and another game made in two (and a half) hours. This time it's an audio game, no graphics. To tell the truth, the idea for this game seemed much cooler in my head than the result, but what am I going to do. I might make a more involved game with the general idea for this game in the future. If you play it, please, excuse my poor diction.

[**Download NSBD System Console**](//www.agj.cl/files/games/nsbds.zip) (Windows, requires [latest Direct X](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/DirectX-9.0c-Redistributable.shtml)). The password is 5467.

Also, remember how Matt made music for my past two Kliks? Well, this time he didn't, because [he made a game himself](http://www.fireandrobot.com/?p=429). Nice!
