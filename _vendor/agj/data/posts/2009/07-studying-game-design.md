The past five weeks I have been 'attending' an online course on game design, generously offered by Ian Schreiber, and named [Game Design Concepts](http://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/). His only condition was that one purchase [the book he co-wrote with Brenda Brathwaite](http://amzn.com/158450580X), precisely for the purpose of teaching, which turned out to be a very good acquisition in itself, and which I might review at some point in the future. The course itself involves a blog, a forum, and a wiki. In the blog, Ian posts, every monday and thursday, a 'lecture', and lists a couple of extra readings; plus, he leaves a 'homeplay' (as he calls it) assignment that usually consists of designing a game under certain limitations, or to make changes to an existing one. That's when the forum comes into play, as everyone is expected to post their game and comment on a few of their peers', to generate some inter-feedback. The wiki is mostly just an aside that has served no significant purpose other than as a space to offer translations of the different lessons.

I've had lots of fun reading the varied essays on games, some of which I would not have read otherwise, as they are about aspects that don't particularly call for my attention. For instance, I'm not very inclined to reading on game systems, even though it's pretty much the core of what constitutes a game, so it's been very useful. The practical work has been stimulating; since I graduated from university, I'd missed that feeling of rushing things to get them in time for class, which ultimately helps to keep me active and on my toes. The course may not be the equivalent of an in-class course, but given the price of admission, it's been fantastic.

I'll be sharing the most noteworthy of my 'homeplays' in more posts to come. They'll certainly be improved over the rather rushed state they're at right now before I post them, though.
