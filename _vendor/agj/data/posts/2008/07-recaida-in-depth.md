This is called Recaída (Relapse,) a decidedly bad and rather cheesy name (the 'caída' part means 'to fall') for an animation I made for school in 2006. It's, as I describe it in the video page, 'a simple story of lost love,' as told in wiggly pen lines, abstracted characters and two colors.

The story behind its creation should start, I guess inevitably, with my getting dumped by a girlfriend that year..., or maybe the year before that (I'm not putting the 'water under the bridge' act, really.) Either way, the truth is that I've always liked misty love stories, the more heart-wrenching the better. Yes, yes, I know. The point is, though, that the girlfriend deal I just mentioned was really only an _excuse_ for me to make a story about dropping down from a great height in hopelessness. No, I never considered suicide, don't worry.

Well, I never stopped to think about this so deeply while drawing the storyboard; it was the night before I had my class, so I had to get something done, and I had previously come up with that squarey character, which looked rather charming and easy to animate to me. In general --and this is a characteristic of mine-- I can finish things quicker and be more satisfied with the result the less time I spend thinking about it, and the more I let it just be whatever and blah: get it over with. So then I can be surprised if it turns out sort of nice, instead of underwhelmed because of all the effort I poured into it (like with another animation I made later, Pixevolución.) So for giggles, here's the [storyboard](/files/2008/07-recaida-in-depth/storyboard1_.pdf) in its finished form, and [a pageful of sketches](//piclog.agj.cl/index.php?showimage=21), for those of you who... Ah, who am I kidding, no one cares about this other than myself.

Only thing left to add is that every frame was drawn freehand with a pen. I didn't even use fancy light boxes or nothing, just like _real men_ do. I cut paper into square pieces and drew on them, then scanned them and... put them in Flash. Which is ridiculous, since Flash is not exactly made for that, but still, it worked I guess. The point was to make an animation using Flash, that was the assignment, but I wanted to make it hand drawn, so I just did it. Oh, and about that breathing sound? Yeah, that was my lazy way of adding sound, which was a requirement; it totally doesn't fit it, but I wanted everything to be made by me (it's an obsession, perhaps,) and I can't play an instrument, sing or make any sort of music, so...
