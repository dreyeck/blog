To get my blog up and running as quick as possible, I initially just grabbed the most simplistic template I could find, and used that. It was still not exactly to my liking, of course, but it was only momentary. Well, six months later, and I was still using the same old thing---so I finally got off my lazy bum and created a new template. I kept it as streamlined as I could, and I like the results. Not everything is complete, though, but it's good enough to use, so things will keep evolving for some time; just expect some rough spots here and there for now (especially if you're not using Firefox---sorry!). You can see [how it used to look](/files/2008/12-new-design/oldblogtemplate.png).
