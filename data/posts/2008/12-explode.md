A first: I finished my [Klik of the Month Klub entry](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/264#comment-1410) within the time limit. It is, sadly, a step down from [last month's](/2008/11/17/where-feat-lofi/). This time I didn't really know what to do, until I just decided to go for this idea of exploding fireworks I had at some point. I didn't feel particularly inspired. The result is not really a game, more like a short-lived toy. [Matt](http://www.fireandrobot.com/) helped out with the music, once again, and it really fits.
