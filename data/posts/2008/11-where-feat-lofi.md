Last saturday I participated again in this month's [Klik of the Month Klub](/2008/08/18/runaway-blast/). This time I didn't use Klik & Play to make my game, because I had heard of a different software, modelled around [Clickteam](http://www.clickteam.com/eng/index.php)'s own (creators of Klik & Play), but improved, called [Construct](http://www.scirra.com/). It's still in beta, but it's a very complete package nonetheless. Much like last time, I used that very day's afternoon to learn to use the software, scribbled a few notes on the game I was going to make, and in the evening, proceeded to spend two hours figuring out how to do stuff. The resulting game is more complex than last time's Runaway Blast, simply because Construct is so much more capable than K&P.

I am forgetting something. Before the event had started, I told my friend [lofi](http://www.fireandrobot.com/) that he should participate too. He didn't want to, though, so I asked him to make some music for my game instead. Luckily for me, he agreed! Truly, the game has become worthy of people's time just because of the cool music that he provided.

What you see above is how the game looks like in its second version. **[Download _Where_](//www.agj.cl/files/games/where2.zip)** and play it, if you feel like it (Windows only). This is a much improved version of [what I originally submitted](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/248#comment-1346) an hour after the deadline (because I had some trouble getting other people to hear the music; other than that, I finished it only ten minutes past the deadline). Since the original suffered from some issues I didn't have the time to fix, I spent several hours figuring out how to do so afterwards. What I didn't have the time for, in the end, was improving the collisions, but that's comparatively minor.

In Where, I just wanted to make some radical decisions. I basically wrote down the first few ideas I came up with, but since it was going to be a very small game, in order to make it memorable, some radical choices needed to be made. This is why I decided to obstruct the player's view with large floating text, and use a psychedelic selection of colors. Since these contributed to a non-harmonic experience, I decided to make the gameplay conceptually frustrating as well: descending a 'tower' with an avatar that can't stop jumping. The text used itself also helps to heighten these principles. And lofi's music felt right at home when I first played it with it.
