It was a busy day! I've been setting up this website, and the only thing I hadn't yet done was post here. Among the update's there's a new main page with links to the blog, the portfolio and the [piclog](//piclog.agj.cl/). The latter is a [Pixelpost](http://www.pixelpost.org/) installation for what some people call a photoblog, but the word has a negative connotation to me (at least [phonetically](http://geo.fotolog.com/directory?country=CI),) and it wasn't meant to be for photographs only, so I chose 'pic,' for picture. The difference with this blog is that the piclog is more of a gallery with not much other than the pictures themselves; to flesh out the process, the ideas or the anecdotes behind them I will use this blog. So they're meant to complement eachother.

I set up a script that lets me more or less automatically send my pictures from the piclog to [my Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alegrilli/). Why the redundance? Because Flickr is more 'connected,' so more friends, or whomever, can find my pictures, comment them, et cetera. I'm not really into text blog communities so I don't intend to do the same with this blog.

Another thing I spend my time in today was uploading videos to Vimeo. I already had a [YouTube account](http://www.youtube.com/user/alegrilli), but since Vimeo has so much nicer image quality, I signed up, and in a couple of hours [I had already uploaded everything](http://www.vimeo.com/agj/). Now my YouTube account is outdated; I'll have to consider whether or not to upload the rest of the stuff there, since I will mostly just be using Vimeo to embed the videos here and get them streaming, to tell the respective tale. Some videos are kind of embarrassingly mediocre-to-bad, though, but I just put them up because they're interesting one way or another.

So, what's still left to do? The hardest work will be making a custom theme for this Wordpress installation. It seems quite a bit more complicated than with Pixelpost, but I'll just have to find the time, because I really dislike the overload of most ready-made themes, and the fact that I can't comfortably go into the code and add a bar with the latest piclog updates, or Vimeo videos, or whatever. What else? Well, I should smoothen out the wrinkles in the piclog, and I also want to, eventually, integrate both blogs with the main page, and maybe the videos too. Not much else, for now!
