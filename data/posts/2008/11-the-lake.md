I made a very quick game (though not quite as quick as the [Klik of the Month](/tag/kotm/) ones) for a competition that is due today. The game is called The Lake, and it's for the TIGSource [Commonplace Book Competition](http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/10/17/tigcompo-commonplace-book). The objective was to create a game inspired by one or several of the brief ideas that H.P. Lovecraft jotted down in his [Commonplace Book](http://www.lapetiteclaudine.com/archives/011196.html), most of which never got turned into full stories. This is what I did; my game is not 'based on' as much as it's just 'triggered' by one of these ideas, though.

My goal was to create a game that would not take me too long to make. I wanted just a full day's work, it ended up being three, but that's quite okay. It was created in Construct, which truly is a great promise for the future, but so full of bugs for the time being. I managed, though. The end result is more of a _short interactive story;_ it's completable in about a single minute, which is a common factor for all my games so far, but in this case the experience is more focused on the narrative. I'm pretty proud of the fact that everything in the game was created by me (well, except for the engine, of course), though I wish I had the time to do something more with the sound design, which was part of the original plan.

As I mentioned above, the idea for the game just came to my mind as if it was a dream when I read one of the entries in the Book. This sounds pretty romantic, but rather than describe the creative process, I want it to be apparent that I applied very few filters on this initial flash. This is why the game may not be very coherent, or have a palpable meaning; nevertheless, it's there, and I tried to make it as close to this initial spark as it was possible in the time that I had available to do it. I think I've just always had a thing for surrealism and their techniques, and this is why I like this kind of pure, unadulterated slice of subconscious, which I oftentimes value more than very produced and over-thought pieces of work. There's more to life than logic, is what I say.
