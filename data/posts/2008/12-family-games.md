As a Christmas gift, I made a game that stars my little sister (she's two-and-a-half) and the rest of the (her) family as 'supporting actors', or 'enemies', if you will. Since I didn't have a lot of time to make it, I went with a really crude style, probably inspired by [Life of D. Duck II](http://www.bjornarb.com/). I also recorded voices for everyone (and even some _things_, namely toys), and a brief guitar tune. The goal was for it to be surprising and funny rather than fun to play, so I made what amounts to a [Road Fighter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tkaS6myAAU) clone, but simpler. In this case, though, you guide Antonella upwards, avoiding objects and people. I called the game _La Hazaña de Anto_ (Anto's Feat). It didn't take them long to finish it, but everyone got to play, so I think the difficulty was just right. They laughed and enjoyed it quite a bit. Mission accomplished!
