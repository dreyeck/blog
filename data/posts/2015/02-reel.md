I've been applying for a Master's at the Tokyo University of the Arts, a program called "New Media". In typical Japanese fashion, there's innumerable hoops I need to hop through for that. One of the steps involved the submission of a physical DVD-Video with a sample of my work (along with other documents), so I created a reel of some of the stuff I've made that I like. It's five minutes long and is comprised of nothing new, but here it is.
