When agj.cl first went live, the only thing that was there was my old portfolio website, made in Flash. It was my first experience with actionscript, back in 2007. I took it down a while ago because it had grown too outdated, and since it was so hackishly conceived, I wasn't planning on updating it. Well, I've finally made [my new portfolio page](//www.agj.cl/portfolio/). Things have changed enough that only two of the works I selected for it remain from the old Flash portfolio.

I've archived [the older one](//www.agj.cl/files/archive/portfolio-1/) (in Spanish) for posterity.
