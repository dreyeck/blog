Since I didn't like [the front page design I made last time](//www.agj.cl/files/archive/front2009-1/), especially because of [that glitch](/2009/01/new-front-page/) in Firefox, I decided to make [a quick new one](//www.agj.cl/), and, in the process, get a bit more acquainted with Javascript. I think that the end result is pretty cute. It works properly at least in Firefox and Internet Explorer.
