Changed the design of the [front page](//www.agj.cl/). Tried something different this time---I wanted it to be more disorderly, less clean; a bit more striking, perhaps. It didn't come out quite how I envisioned it, but it will have to do, for now. The main reason for this redesign was that I wanted all the links to my different accounts at community websites there. I had something else entirely in mind at first, a design that integrated the last few piclog thumbnails and blog headlines, but since I don't know much Javascript or PHP, all that will have to wait until I have the time to sit down and learn.

There is something I still don't understand, which happened in the [old design](//www.agj.cl/files/archive/front2008-3/) too, and that is some Firefox rendering glitches when it first loads the page. After refreshing, it goes away. My guess is that it's a bug related to blocks with the CSS display property set to 'none', which is how I make the popup effect. Well, nevermind the jargon, but the point is that it somehow screws up the design.
