I'm sorry to bring it up again, but, as it turns out, [The Lake](/tag/the-lake/) earned [ninth place in the TIGSource Commonplace Book competition](http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/12/24/commonplace-book-compo-results), so I'm quite proud. On top of that, the game made it into [an article in the PC Gamer UK magazine](/files/2009/01-more-on-lakes/pc_gamer_lovecraft_writeup_big.jpg). That screenshot comes courtesy of [Terry Cavanagh](http://distractionware.com/).
