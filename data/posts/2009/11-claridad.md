<video-embed service="vimeo" id="6187924" width="500" height="375" />

Made this video quite a while ago, but neglected to post it here. It was made for an art exhibition ([Expo Arte y Bicicleta](http://www.bicicultura.cl/2009/09/07/con-exposicion-de-arte-y-bicicleta-se-inauguro-iv-festival-internacional-de-bicicultura-de-santiago-2009)) open to submissions by anyone, and in pretty much any format (other than video, it included paintings, sculptures, volumetric collages, music, poetry...), as long as it featured the bicycle in some way. Fun idea. I quickly made this with recycled footage from [Volcano](/2009/01/volcano/). I love these kinds of collages, as you can see [here](//piclog.agj.cl/index.php?showimage=63) and [here](//piclog.agj.cl/index.php?showimage=64). In the end, the one day I visited the exhibition (which was in a public area in a Metro station, here in Santiago), the projector that was supposed to rotatively display the videos wasn't even on. Ah, well.

Also with stuff from Volcano, but more recently (just five days ago) I made [this 5 by 5](http://www.vimeo.com/7512616): five clips, five seconds in length. A quickie, just for fun.
