I couldn't pass up the opportunity to participate in this weekend's [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/), as it had been too long since I last made (and released) a game. This time I didn't make a fancy timelapse video or anything like, but I did spend some time on Friday learning to use the beautiful [Flixel](http://flixel.org/), and then the weekend bending it to my nonstandard needs. The result is a game, unlike last time, though not exactly what I set out to do. Still, it's playable. And it fits the 'exploration' theme.

I made this animated GIF over a year ago, thinking of an idea for a game I envisioned for the Game Boy Advance. This game was to be a bichrome, [Knytt](http://nifflas.ni2.se/index.php?page=1003Knytt)-inspired platformer. I decided to reuse the core of this idea: that is, the running on walls and ceilings, and a tad more. It was simplified to the essence, though: the little guy won't stop running, so all you can do is jump in order to steer him where you want to go. It feels a bit like controlling a jumping, sticky train.

This time around I didn't neglect to provide the [source code](//www.agj.cl/files/games/climbrunner-ld/climbrunner-source.zip).
