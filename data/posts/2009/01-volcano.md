A few weeks ago, [Matt](http://www.fireandrobot.com/) showed me a preview of a song he was working on, called Volcano. I liked it so much that I decided to make a video for it. After I graduated, I finally got around to making said video. And now it's done!

In the meanwhile, he released the EP the song is a part of; it's called [Moonfish Moon](http://www.fireandrobot.com/?p=361). I recommend you give it a listen if you liked Volcano.

This was about a week's work, shooting around the neighborhood, here in Santiago, Chile. I filled up almost three miniDV tapes of footage, which seems to be a lot for under four minutes of edited video, or maybe I'm just not used to this kind of stuff. I also discovered only yesterday that this Handycam that I used has a manual exposure setting, which would have been useful for many of the earlier shots, but such is life.

I also got myself a new bycicle a week ago, which can be partially seen in one of the shots. It's a cheap 'beach cruiser,' but I love my new bike.
