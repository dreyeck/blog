I've completed a new videogame—another entry in [another TIGSource competition](http://tigsource.com/articles/2009/02/20/cockpit-compo). The theme, this time, is 'cockpits'. My game is pretty much on the fringe in the way it implements the theme, though. What I originally intended to make was some manner of car driving game, inspired by the original [_Out Run_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiWiTXq4yYY), since I'm such a big fan of the series, and because I love the aesthetic of that kind of low-tech 3D. I might do this in the future; we'll see how creating such an engine will go for me. But the game I ended up conceiving, because I only had roughly a week to make it (until the deadline was extended another week), is not about driving anything at all, it is merely about _looking_; how much more simple can a game's interface and set of verbs get? You are still in some kind of convertible sportscar, but you're just sitting on the passenger's seat.

I've coined the term 'narrative exploration' to describe Viewpoints, because the very core of the concept is about exploring, but not a physical space, like in, say, _Metroid_, but, instead, a space of different possible stories—a narrative space. The concept itself was shamelessly ripped from Terry Cavanagh's [_Pathways_](http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=650) —a short game I can wholeheartedly recommend—, though his execution is different from mine (I'm not quite that flagrant).

Also, for this past April Fools', I made a variation of Viewpoints and released it as if it were the finished game for the competition. I took the Out Run and Sega inspiration further, and created something quite ridiculous. I call it [_**Winner**_](//www.agj.cl/files/games/winner/). (It may be worth mentioning that some of the contents of this variation were taken straight from Sega-made games.)
