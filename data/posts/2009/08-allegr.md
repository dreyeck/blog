Sort of a [Towlr](http://www.towlr.com/)-like game, created for this month's [Klik](/tag/kotm/). The twist comes at the end. You'll need to play it more than once to "get" it, though.

It was hard making this one. Or, rather, it was disappointing. It took me an hour an a half to realize that my approach was not facilitated by the software, so I ended up having to patch it up and turn it into a much simplified version of what I had envisioned.
