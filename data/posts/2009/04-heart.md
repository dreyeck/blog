What you see above is my computer screen during the past weekend (each hour reduced to 2.5 seconds), as I make two games for two events that were held concurrently. One is a competition called [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/), on which, during the 48 hours of its duration, participants are expected to create a game by themselves and 'from scratch'. The week prior, participants vote on a theme. 'Advancing wall of doom' won this time, which is not one I'm too fond of, but I did participate and make a game. Or two, in fact, because for the other event, my [usual](/tag/kotm/) two-hour [Klik of the Month](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/44), I made a game based on the same theme.

[_**Heart**_](//www.agj.cl/files/games/heart-ld/) is the name of [my Ludum Dare entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/?category_name=ld14&author_name=agj). The game is not final, and neither is the name, so let's say it's the competition version's name. It was inspired by Stephen Lavelle's [_Defect_](http://www.increpare.com/tag/defect/). It was made for Flash, using the Flex SDK and coded in Actionscript 3. I'll probably post more about it in the future, when I decide that the game is finished.

[_**Hope!**_](//www.agj.cl/files/games/hope.zip) is what I called [my Klik of the Month](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/291). It was made in Construct, so it's Windows only. You will need [the latest DirectX](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/DirectX-9.0c-Redistributable.shtml) to run it.
