> _The music room is here because this house is large enough to have one. I took advantage of it as a kid. The most notorious protagonist here is the piano, but other instruments adorn the wall._

My first standard interactive fiction (text game that takes typed commands as input), created for the Klik of the Month. Powered by [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/); fueled by my general opinion on IF.
