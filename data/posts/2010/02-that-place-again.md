<video-embed service="vimeo" id="9476412" width="500" height="281" />

I decided to make a new video, as an exercise. A quickieâ€”took me two days. [Another](/2009/01/volcano/) music video, but this one is for a song I made myself [a good while ago](/2008/12/the-color-and-the-leaves/), together with [Matt Peter](http://www.fireandrobot.com/).

I used a few family photos from the late eighties, playing up their graininess and color patterns. Their texture made for a much less mechanic-looking set of kaleidoscopic compositions than what is probably the norm. It was also my intention to play with alternately obscuring and revealing the nature of the images, hiding them in the geometry, and slowly giving way to recognizable objects and people. The middle section is intentionally psychedelic, switching to meet the mood of the music. Toward the end it's much more of a nostalgic slide-show of memories.
