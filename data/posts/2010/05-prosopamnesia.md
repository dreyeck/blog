After [Wirewalk](/tag/wirewalk/), I felt inspired to do more work using images acquired through web searches. Yes, I failed to mention it when I released that one, but the images are obtained at run-time through Google Images. I'm rather proud of this particular result:

**_[Prosopamnesia](//www.agj.cl/files/games/prosopamnesia/)_** (Flash)

It was made for The Games Collective [negative capability pageant](http://www.thegamescollective.org/index.php/topic,44.0.html). For sound, I used the [port](http://code.google.com/p/as3sfxr/) of DrPetter's [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) to AS3, by Thomas Vian. Also used theÂ [Google API AS3 library](http://code.google.com/p/googleas3api/) by Joris Timmerman, as for Wirewalk.
