This month I made a kind of [klik](/tag/kotm/) that took advantage of the foundations laid out inÂ [Wirewalk](/tag/wirewalk/), [Prosopamnesia](/tag/prosopamnesia/),[ ](/tag/prosopamnesia/)and other unreleased experiments also dealing with image searches. This made it so easy to make, that I achieved my initial concept within the first hour. This first idea involved no interactions, so I used the following hour (of two that the monthly event lasts) to add that layer of interactivity.
