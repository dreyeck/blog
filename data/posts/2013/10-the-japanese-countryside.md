I just came back from Japan, after spending six months improving my Japanese there at a language school and generally enjoying being in such a culturally interesting environment. I made tons of friends, Japanese and from countless other countries; it was extremely stimulating.

The place I lived at was a small city called Ueda, located in a valley in the mountainous Nagano prefecture. If you asked someone from one of the bigger cities in Japan, they'd say where I lived was what they call _inaka,_ the countryside. But would you ask the people who had lived there their whole lives, or in one of the surrounding, smaller cities and towns, they would say no, that's not _inaka._ Of course, me coming from a pretty large city, the place was small and cozy; refreshingly so. I started using _Vine_ —the short video recording app— during this trip, so here are some of the best 'moving photos' I captured from those places.
