I usually don't update my games, but since I decided to put [Runnerby](/tag/runnerby/) in my [portfolio](//www.agj.cl/portfolio/), some of its issues had been bugging me. So, I updated it. Now, the music pauses when the Flash applet loses focus, and there is a title screen that forces you to click and press space before starting the game, which should resolve any confusion over keys not doing anything (caused by Flash first lacking focus), and not knowing what key to use to play, for the beginners. I actually copied this last technique from [Mode](http://adamatomic.com/mode/), the example game that Adam Saltsman made for [Flixel](http://flixel.org/). My game still retains its other problems.
