Over at Glorious Trainwrecks, a spambot started [an event](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/4281), and thus we had to comply and make stuff. I didn't really make a game; it's a silly visualization of Noyb's [readings of (other) spambot postings](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/1529).

The audio may or may not sync with the text for you, depending on your configuration. Try reloading if it doesn't, and if it still won't, then I think you're out of luck.

A shoutout to Kirk Israel for his useful [lowLag.js](http://lowlag.alienbill.com/).
