> January, the month named after the Roman god Janus. A god of thresholds between past and future, here and there, he is depicted as having a head bearing two faces staring simultaneously forward and back.

In my first collaboration with [GregWS](http://gregws.ca/), we made a small text game about parallels. We each independently created a literary space by way of the description of places and situations, and then combined the two into a criss-crossing meandering. Fun for the whole family.
