This blog is a static website, which means that it runs nothing on the server and has no database. It was programmed in [Elm][elm], using the [elm-pages][elm-pages] framework and [Tailwind CSS][tailwind] for the styling. [The source code is available on Github.][source] It was coded mostly using the [Helix][helix] editor.

This website collects no data from its users.

Neither the content nor the code of this blog were made using generative AI technologies such as LLMs. (This possibly does not include all library code.)
