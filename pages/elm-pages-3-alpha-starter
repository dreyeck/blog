It was tricky to wrangle it to find the simpler thing, but now that I've got it it feels really natural to just give a file with that simple render function interface.\nI started a GitHub Discussion thread about adapters. I think it would be great to discuss questions, implementations, and ideas over there as I'm sure people will want to explore a lot of different frameworks/hosts. [https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/discussions/378 page]. I would love it if people would chime in over there and share their ideas or what they've been able to build!"

It was tricky to wrangle it to find the simpler thing, but now that I've got it it feels really natural to just give a file with that simple render function interface.\nI started a GitHub Discussion thread about adapters. I think it would be great to discuss questions, implementations, and ideas over there as I'm sure people will want to explore a lot of different frameworks/hosts. [https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/discussions/378 page]. I would love it if people would chime in over there and share their ideas or what they've been able to build!"
